## 2. Setting up your own configuration.
If you use a different configuration, **[please click here!](https://gamepadviewer.com/#remap)** When the page loads, press a button on your controller and select **"Player 1"** for **"Please select the controller to use as a mapping base"**.

### a. Setting up a button macro.
Settings up your button macros to match your own configuration ingame.
* Click **"Add New Mapping"** and select the button in the dropdown menu that has the button macro you desire as listed in **[Default Mapping](https://pete-lawrence.github.io/#3-default-mapping)**.

* Click **"Click to Set"** and press the button on your controller that you want the button macro applied to (before **"Waiting for Button Press..."** times out).

* Click **"Add New Mapping"** again and select the button in the dropdown menu you applied the macro to and click **"Disable"**. This prevents button macros from overlapping.

* Repeat as many times as needed to cover all your button macros before moving onto disabling unused buttons.

### b. Disabling a button.
When you're done setting up button macros, time to tidy things up by disabling all the unused buttons.
* Click **"Add New Mapping"** and select the button in the dropdown menu that has a button macro you **DO NOT USE** as listed in **[Default Mapping](https://pete-lawrence.github.io/#3-default-mapping)** and then click **"Disable"**. Don't worry if that button you disabled is a button you want to apply a *different* macro to.

### c. Export configuration.
When you are done follow these steps in this order, 
1. Press **"Apply Mapping"**

2. Press **"Export Mapping to URL Generator"**

3. Paste this link into **"Custom CSS URL:**" [https://pete-lawrence.github.io/tekken.css](https://pete-lawrence.github.io/tekken/tekken.css)

4. Finally create a **Browser source in OBS** with a Width of **1000** and Height of **400** and paste in the **generated URL**.

## 3. Default Mapping
X/Square = **1**

Y/Triangle = **2**

A/Cross = **3**

B/Circle = **4**


RB/R1 = **RA**

RT/R2 = **1+4**


LB/L1 = **2+4**

LT/L2 = **2+3**


RS/R3 = **3+4**

LS/L3 = **1+2**


Start = **1+3**

Select/Back = **1+2+3+4**


## 4. Bonus Skins
**Copy and paste the code below into "custom CSS" in the browser window for OBS**

Note: You will have to wait around 20 seconds before it updates so don't panic if it doesn't instantly work.
